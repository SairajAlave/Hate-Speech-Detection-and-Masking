# Hate-Speech-Detection-and-Masking
This project aims to develop a system capable of detecting and masking hate speech in real-time using machine learning techniques. The solution is integrated into a Chrome extension that automatically scans and modifies web content to filter out toxic or offensive language, ensuring a safer and more inclusive digital environment.
